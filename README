django-messages-framework by Django developers
backported by Michael Huynh (mike@mikexstudios.com)

NOTE: The master branch is an exact mirror of trunk/django/contrib/comments.

The backported version lives in the 'backport' branch! So switch to that to see
the goods!

Purpose:
-------

Django's messages framework is very powerful, but only available in trunk. This
package is a backport of the messages framework for 1.1.1.

Tested:
------

Only on Django 1.1.1.

How to use
----------

Usage is the same as described on:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/messages/

The only difference is that you replace mentions of 'django.contrib.messages'
with 'django_messages_framework'.
